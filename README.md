Works with the Yahoo Dataset, I use gzip to read the files directly without extracting them locally

Kdd_own_Kmeans.ipynb
Contains the code for computing centroids using Kmeans++ Scikit-learns init-centroids method before calling Kmeans/ mini-Batch Kmeans.

kplusplus_init(X, K) method in Analysis of Kdd-Copy1.ipynb
is my own implementation to compute Kmeans++ centroids which is really slow.

Code to produce some plots for the timing and errors.
